QUESTIONS 

neural network - do random initialized connection weights with positive values stay positive and similar for negative initialized? 

identify connection weights that switch signs… 

in final weights, are half negative and half positive? - seem both have mean near zero

what if initial weights are skewed positive? - negative? 

randomizing then sorting initial weights doesn’t work well - seem to want to be random value and random location initially

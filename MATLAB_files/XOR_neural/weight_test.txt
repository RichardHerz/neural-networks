WHAT HAPPENS IF CUT THEM ALL IN HALF?

SEE BELOW - CONCLUSION IS THAT NETWORK STILL WORKS BUT ERROR GOES UP

GOOD - no errors 
input: 0 1 
y is 1 
yex is 0.965061
weight min = -16.5726, weight max = 17.327 

CUT WEIGHTS IN HALF  

GOOD - no errors 
input: 0 1 
y is 1

======= TRIAL 2 ======= 

GOOD - no errors 
input: 0 1 
y is 1 
yex is 0.978312 
weight min = -10.155, weight max = 14.0484
